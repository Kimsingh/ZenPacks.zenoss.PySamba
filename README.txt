PySamba
-------

This package provides the python interface to the Samba C library and
executable targets used by other ZenPacks for Windows device monitoring.

This package does not itself provide any additional functionality for Zenoss.

The build process for this package requires the Google Breakpad client library
be available in $ZENHOME/lib - which is created as part of the Zenoss Core
installation process.
